# BankingClass

## Introduction

This project is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It simulates basic ATM functionalities, providing a practical example of how OOP principles can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into five main Java classes, each representing a key component of the ATM system:

1. `ATM.java`: The main class that runs the ATM simulation.
2. `Bank.java`: Represents the bank, managing users and accounts.
3. `User.java`: Represents a bank user with personal information and accounts.
4. `Account.java`: Represents a bank account with associated transactions.
5. `Transaction.java`: Represents individual financial transactions.
